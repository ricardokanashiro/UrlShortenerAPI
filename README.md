    method: 'POST', 
    body: JSON.stringify({
        "url": "https://github.com/ricardokanashiro"
    }),
    headers:{
        "Content-Type" : "application/json",
    }}
)
    .then(data => res = data.json())
    .catch(console.log)

    // Response: { "shortUrl": "http://localhost:3333/_3Ayh78v" }
```

- <b>Node</b>: javascript runtime based on Chrome V8 Engine, used to run javascript off browser
- <b>Fastify</b>: micro nodejs framework used to handle http requests and more easier and faster
- <b>PostgreSQL</b>: a open-source, free and powerful sql database

## How to Use:

### Getting Started:

To run this project in your device you should need some softwares/programs installed in your system:

- <b>Node</b>: is a javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used to run javascript as a server in this case. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Download</a>
- <b>Npm</b>: is a package manager distributed with Node.js, so if you already have NodeJs in your system, you automatically have npm. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Download</a>
- <b>Yarn</b>: is a package manager provided by Meta, and it's another solution as npm. <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable">Download</a>

‚ö†Ô∏è Tip: once we have package json, you can install all dependencies using npm or yarn, no need to install both.

### How to Install

To run this API locally follow the following steps:

- This commands will download the project in your device and access his file:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ricardokanashiro/UrlShortenerAPI.git
    git cd UrlShortenerAPI
```

- This commands will install all the project dependencies and run the server:

```bash
    npm install
    npm server
```

or 

```bash
    yarn install
    yarn server
```

### Configuring Database and Env Variables

- This project uses a Postgres database provided by <a href="https://neon.tech/">Neon</a>, that is a service that allows you to 
instantly branch your Postgres database to support modern development workflows. So to run this application, you can create a serverless postgres database
or made one locally.

- You also need to create a .env file with some enviroment variables:

```.env
    PGHOST='****'
    PGDATABASE='****'
    PGUSER='****'
    PGPASSWORD='****'
    ENDPOINT_ID='****'

    ENABLED_CORS='****'
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Tip: PGHOST, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD and ENDPOINT_ID are variables used to connect with postgres database. 
And ENABLED_CORS is a string that contains all URLs, that must be splitted by ';', that are allowed to access the API
